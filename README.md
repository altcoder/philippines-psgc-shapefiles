## Conventions

PSGC PSA's new 10-digit coding structure and stored as numeric format.

![PSGC](docs/psgc.pngimage.png)

For convenience, parent PSGC codes are also stored in the datasets. This can be useful when joining across administrative levels.

## Source Files

Maps are using EPSG:32651, Lat/Long projection.

The 2023 Level 0 to 4 raw shapefiles came from [OCHA Services Website](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-phl). This dataset was cleaned up and matched with the most recent PSGC codes and location names. The shapefile was also updated to reflect merging of locations.

### Old Sources
If you are using an older version of this project (2019) the source data for that uses:

The 2015 Level 0 to 3 shapefiles came from [OCHA Services Website](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/philippines-administrative-levels-0-to-3) (Not Available Anymore).

The 2015 Level 4 shapefiles came from [this Github Repo](https://github.com/justinelliotmeyers/official_philippines_shapefile_data_2016)

The 2011 Level 0 to 4 shapefiles came from [GADM Website Data](https://gadm.org)

Please refer to the [PSGC Summary of Changes](https://psa.gov.ph/classification/psgc)
to take into account potential issues that may arise when using these maps together with your datasets.
